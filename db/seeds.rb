Specialty.create!(name: 'Astrological Counselling', description: 'Astrological counselling combines traditional astrological knowledge and techniques with therapeutic counselling. Sessions can include readings of your natal birth chart, along with in-depth exploration and discussions of major themes in your life, including blockages, challenges, family dynamics, self-development, and future goals. The intention is to help clients understand recurrent patterns in their lives and safely integrate this information toward growth and healing.', risk: 'Counselling with astrology is intended to help clients develop a deeper level of self-awareness behind their motives and behaviours and find harmonious ways to live. The intention is not to fortune tell or predict the future, even though we are to experience personal crises that coincide with planetary patterns at specific points of our lives.', specialty_category_id: 5)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Biofield Tuning', description: 'Biofield Tuning is an energy healing modality that uses sound therapy through tuning forks to clear blockages and disturbances in a client’s energy field. It is based on the premise that the human biofield - the energy field surrounding and permeates our bodies - is connected with our conscious and subconscious minds. Physical, mental, and emotional disorders can manifest when we experience “dissonance” (simply put, lack of harmony) in our energy fields. Biofield tuning helps restore balance in our energy field and alleviate the related symptoms such as pain, anxiety, insomnia, migraines, depression, fibromyalgia, and digestive disorders.', risk: 'Biofield tuning is not advised for extremely ill individuals, as it may create a strong healing response in the system. Those with cancer, pregnancy, palliative care, and pacemakers are advised to check with their healthcare provider to see if biofield tuning suits them.', specialty_category_id: 7)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Biotherapy', description: 'Biotherapy is a form of immunotherapy and energy medicine that uses the bioenergy from one human body (the therapist) to evoke changes in the bioenergy field in another human body (the patient). All living things have a biofield within them. Biotherapy allows us to bio-hack clients’ immune systems through the interaction of human bioenergy, stimulating and modulating the body on a cellular level to trigger an immune response. The therapist generates a low-level signal, using a combination of structured and organized hand gestures to generate a high and low potential of electromagnetic bioenergy. This excites the tissues and cells in a local area of the patient’s body and knocks the cellular structure off balance (ex. Inflammation), sending a danger signal that will elevate an immune response. With the need to rebalance the temporary change caused by the Biotherapy treatment, the immune system kicks in and starts to repair and brings the cells and tissues back to homeostasis. ', risk: 'Biotherapy is a non-invasive treatment and is complementary to other medical treatments and medications that your doctor prescribed.', specialty_category_id: 6)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Breathwork', description: 'Breathwork is the practice of controlling your breathing rate and depth to bring awareness to your breath. It has roots in Eastern practices like yoga, Tai Chi and Buddhism, and reaps the same benefits from a meditative practice. Breathwork is a great way to help relieve mental, emotional, and physical tension, such as reducing stress, reducing inflammation, and alkalizing your blood PH levels. There are several forms of breathwork practices, including Pranayama, Holotropic, and Rebirthing, each with its own unique set of technique, use, and benefits.', risk: 'Breathwork is generally safe and well-tolerated for most people. It is not suited for those with a known cardiac arrhythmia (such as a very slow heart rate), a history of heart block, or those who are taking certain antipsychotic medications. Please check with your practitioner to see if this practice would be suitable for you. ', specialty_category_id: 6)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Business Coaching', description: 'Business coaching helps individuals looking for actionable feedback, personalized advice, growth plans, and strategies to achieve their goals and grow their businesses. Many business coaches also take a holistic approach to coaching and help clients identify personal blocks from leading a healthy and fulfilling life.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 5)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Energy Healing', description: 'Energy healing is an alternative and complementary healing modality that removes blocks in the body’s energy systems. Energy therapies sought to clear disturbances in the human biofield, and by restoring a natural flow of energy, the body’s own ability to heal is optimized. The result is the reduction of stress, anxiety, and physical tension and the promotion of healing and general well-being. There are many types of energy therapies, including Biofield Tuning, Reiki, and Qigong. They often entail using the practitioner’s hands, with or without touch on/over the body, to restore the balance of energy.', risk: 'It’s important to note that energy healing is a complementary modality that shouldn’t exclude any Western medicine you may be taking.', specialty_category_id: 3)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Fitness Training', description: 'Fitness is an integral part of one’s well-being and can significantly influence one’s quality of life. Fitness training aims to work towards long-term goals of improving one’s health and well-being, rather than narrow or short-term goals of sport competition, larger muscles, or concerns over appearance. A personal coach can help you create a long-term and sustainable fitness strategy to optimize your health and instill balance in your life.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 2)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Functional Medicine', description: 'Functional Medicine is a holistic approach to chronic disease management that addresses the root cause(s) of illnesses. It takes a deep dive into a patient’s life story, including their environment, lifestyle habits, and medical history, to identify triggers to their illness. These triggers could be poor nutrition, stress, toxins, allergens, genetics, and microbiome. The provider will work with you to develop a highly personalized plan to help you address your illness, optimize your health, and prevent the rise of chronic diseases.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 8)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Herbal Medicine', description: 'Herbal Medicine or “herbology” uses medicinal plants and botanicals to treat diseases or/and maintain health. It has been widely used in Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat and prevent illnesses. The goal of herbology is to alleviate symptoms or treat a specific disease and support an individual’s intrinsic health and promote overall well-being.', risk: 'Please check with your provider or herbalist to see if you are allergic to specific herbal remedies.', specialty_category_id: 8)

A Human Design chart or a “BodyGraph” is generated based on your birth date, time, and place. It reveals in-depth insights into our talents, skills, potential, along with strategies and practical techniques to help us make decisions that can significantly enhance our experience of life.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 5)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Hypnotherapy', description: 'Hypnotherapy is a form of therapy used to reprogram the subconscious mind. It works by putting our mind and body into a heightened state of learning, making us more susceptible to suggestions for self-improvement or behaviour changes. Hypnotherapy is commonly used along with psychotherapy (counselling or therapy) to help patients explore a possible psychological root cause of a disorder, such as traumatic past events or memories they might have suppressed. It is also commonly used as suggestive therapy in changing behaviours such as eliminating phobias, managing pain, and quitting addictive behaviours. A hypnotherapist\'s goal is not to control a person or give the person answers, but to help the person resolve their problems.', risk: 'It is important to note that while hypnotherapy can help with pain management, it does not cure diseases like cancer or heart disease. Hypnosis also requires the willingness of participants to focus their attention and follow the suggestions of their therapists. One cannot be hypnotized unwillingly, and when you are hypnotized, you will not follow directions against your wishes.', specialty_category_id: 6)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Infant & Child Sleep Coaching', description: 'Sleep is essential for a person’s health and well-being but is an area many families and new parents struggle with when they welcome new household members. A sleep coach/consultant provides strategies and support to families in developing healthy sleep habits and understanding sleep behaviour and physiology in early development.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 5)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Life Coaching', description: 'Life coaching is intended to help you identify your goals, the obstacles and/or limiting beliefs that keep getting in your way, and developing a customized action plan to help you achieve them. A life coach can counsel clients on a range of professional and personal issues. Unlike a counsellor or therapist, a life coach helps you with specific professional projects, personal goals, and/or transitions and is more action-oriented than insight-oriented. It is a common misconception that life coaches provide advice. A life coach\'s purpose is to help facilitate the client’s process of connecting to their inner wisdom and make choices about their actions and next steps from that place of connection.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 5)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Meditation', description: 'Meditation is indeed learning to work with the mind. It is “the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religions activity or as a way of becoming calm and relaxed,” or “serious thought or study, or the product of this activity.” So meditation can involve focusing, relaxing, pondering or the expression of these.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 6)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Naturopathy', description: 'Naturopathic Medicine is a holistic approach that uses natural remedies to help the body heal itself. It uses many complementary therapies such as Herbal Medicine, massage, acupuncture, and nutritional counselling to heal the root cause(s) of an illness. It also focuses on lifestyle changes to prevent chronic diseases. Naturopathic doctors can prescribe medications such as antibiotics.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 8)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Nutrition Coaching', description: 'A nutrition coach helps you analyze your diet and develop an individualized plan to form healthier eating habits and food choices that would fit your lifestyle. Whether you are looking for a complete diet overhaul, want to get inspiration for healthy recipes or adjust your food choices, or looking to manage a medical condition, anyone can benefit from working with a nutrition coach. Some of the specific conditions that can benefit from dietary interventions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, allergies, digestive issues including irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, diabetes or pre-diabetic conditions, obesity or overweight, and pregnancy.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 2)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Rapid Transformational Therapy', description: 'Rapid Transformational Therapy is a hybrid therapy that combines Hypnotherapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Psychotherapy, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and Regression Therapy. RTT works by accessing the subconscious mind to help you uncover and reprogram limiting beliefs and find the psychological root cause of mental or physical pain, pattern, or behaviour. Clients receive healing by discovering and understanding why an issue developed and why it persists in their life and releasing emotions attached to the event or belief generated in the past. While the approach is similar to hypnotherapy, RTT delivers rapid results in one to three 90 - 120 minute sessions.', risk: 'Regression therapy focuses on resolving significant past events that might be interfering with a person’s present mental and emotional wellness. Those with sound mental health who are confident that a review of past events will not adversely impact their mental state should participate. Please speak to your practitioner if you have any past or existing concerns about your mental health.', specialty_category_id: 6)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Reiki', description: 'Reiki is a form of energy healing that originated in Japan in the late 1800s. Reiki is derived from the Japanese words “rei” (universal) and “ki” (life energy). It involves the transfer of energy from the practitioner’s hands to their patient. The Reiki practitioner unblocks any stagnant energy in a patient’s body where a physical injury or emotional pain is present. Improving the flow of energy can lead to relaxation, reduce pain and symptoms of illness, and promote the body’s natural healing processes. It can also help people alleviate emotional stress and improve their overall well-being.', risk: '', specialty_category_id: 3)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Traditional Chinese Medicine', description: 'Traditional Chinese Medicine is a system of medicine that has been used for thousands of years and originated in China. It uses an array of therapies including acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping (the use of warmed glass jars to create suction on certain points of the body), and massage to restore balance to someone’s “Qi”, a vital force of energy that flows along pathways in the body called meridians. Any imbalance to the Qi can cause disease and illness. The objective of TCM is to restore a yin and yang balance between the internal body organs and the external elements of earth, fire, water, wood and metal. TCM has been used to treat problems such as asthma, allergies, and infertility.', risk: 'TCM should not be used as a replacement for conventional or allopathic treatment, especially for severe conditions, but it may be beneficial when used as a complementary therapy. Since some TCM herbal medicines can interfere or be toxic when combined with Western treatments, you should inform your doctor if you are using TCM.', specialty_category_id: 8)
Specialty.create!(name: 'Yoga', description: 'Yoga is a mind-body practice with a 5,000-year practice that originated from India designed to stimulate inner peace and physical energy through the focus of poses. Yoga is an excellent form of physical movement that can help you strengthen your flexibility and give you more energy, but it also facilitates mental focus and relaxation. Yoga can also help you unblock your chakras - the center points of energy, thoughts, feelings and physical body - to remove physical, mental or emotional imbalances that may manifest in physical illnesses, such as anxiety, lethargy or poor digestion.', risk: 'Yoga is generally low-impact and safe for anyone with a well-trained instructor. However, individuals who are pregnant or have medical conditions such as high blood pressure, glaucoma, or sciatica should talk to the practitioner first before practicing. They may need to alter or avoid some poses. When using yoga to manage a medical condition, please also do not use it as a substitute for conventional medical care. Do not postpone seeing a healthcare provider about a severe medical problem.', specialty_category_id: 1)

Faq.create(question: 'What is The Holistic Panda, and how are you different from other search platforms? ', answer: 'The Holistic Panda is an online discovery marketplace that enables you to find and book a diverse range of holistic services provided by trusted practitioners. We are different from other marketplaces as our search focuses on matching you with the holistic services that best suit your health goals. We want to make your quest to improve your health and well-being as easy and straightforward as possible, so let us help you navigate this process and find the right service.', audience: 'users')
Faq.create(question: 'What is a speciality?', answer: 'A speciality is a specific area where the practitioner has devoted much time to practicing and excelling. Some examples of specialities include naturopathy, functional medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, nutritional coaching, and counselling.', audience: 'users')
Faq.create(question: 'What is a health goal?', answer: 'A health goal is an area in your life you want to improve on, such as developing better eating habits or learning to manage your stress. It does not necessarily have to be an existing medical condition because your health journey can start at any point and stage.', audience: 'users')
Faq.create(question: 'I think some of the words are misspelled, such as speciality. Shouldn\'t it be  \'specialty\'?', answer: 'We are a Canadian company, and as part of the Commonwealth, British English is usually the standard. We also want to service our global community, where the use of British English is prevalent.', audience: 'users')
Faq.create(question: 'What exactly is holistic health?', answer: 'The word \'holistic\' is characterized by the treatment of the whole person, taking account of mental and social factors. Holistic therapies aim to fix the root causes of the condition and not only alleviate the symptoms. They can be complementary and alternative healing practices that overlap with modern-day western medicine, such as acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, massage therapy, and Reiki. They can also be counselling, life coaching, and fitness sessions that aim to examine an individual and his/her well-being as a whole - mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, creatively - and develop a complete, holistic resolution that tackles all of these areas.', audience: 'users')
Faq.create(question: 'What kind of practitioners can I find on your platform?', answer: 'We currently have practitioners across 20 specialties, ranging from energy healers to fitness and nutrition coaches. We also have practitioners from multiple cultural backgrounds as we know health can be influenced by culture, whether it’s the perception of health or the approaches to health promotion, or the types of treatment clients prefer. We currently have practitioners from the US and Canada but are actively looking to onboard practitioners from other countries to expand the range of services and representation of practitioners we offer.', audience: 'users')
Faq.create(question: 'What is the cost of using your platform?', answer: 'There’s no cost or service fee for users to set up an account and use our platform. The only fee you will pay is for the service provided by the practitioner.', audience: 'users')
Faq.create(question: 'How does it work?', answer: 'The Holistic Panda enables you to easily search for one-on-one sessions with trusted wellness practitioners based on your health goals. You can also filter the sessions by specialities, language preferences, and session type (either virtual or in-person sessions).  Found a session you like? Submit a booking request and await your confirmation, and on you go. It’s that easy. For more information, please refer to our “how it works” section on our homepage.', audience: 'users')
