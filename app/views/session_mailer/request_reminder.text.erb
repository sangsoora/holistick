Dear <%= @practitioner.user.first_name %>,

Donâ€™t leave your client hanging!

You have a session request from <%= @session.user.full_name %> for <%= @session.service.name %> that needs your confirmation. If none of the proposed times are workable for you, please decline the session request and message the client in the chatbox to coordinate a new time.

<%= link_to session_url(@session) %>

If you have any questions or need support, please contact us at practitioner@theholisticpanda.com. We're here to help!

Yours,
The Holistic Panda Team
