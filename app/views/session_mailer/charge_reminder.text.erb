Dear <%= @practitioner.user.first_name %>,

We noticed you didn’t charge your session <%= @session.service.name %> with <%= @session.user.full_name %>. You’ll need to do so to receive your payout.

Here is a simple user guide on how to charge your session:

Go to link below or click “sessions as practitioner” under the drop-down menu after logging into your account

Go to the “Pending payment” tab

Find the completed session and click “Charge”

<%= practitioner_sessions_url %>
